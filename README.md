# BurgerApp

## Intro
We had to create a burger app that demonstrates the user adding a burger name, submitting it, and then choosing to devour the burger they just added.

6. db

    * css

## Issues I've Faced

Even though I got the app to work i'm having a hard time with my "radio and input button" It would not submit without them and I've tried everything to take them off so I eventually kept it in but i'm planning to take it off in the future when I upload it. I've also had trouble with Heroku and how it works. Alot of password changing and hooking it up so it displays on there.
